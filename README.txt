Data science techniques have been incorporated to analyse various data sets in order to find if there are correlation between certain variables. This is achieved through both simulation and statistical methods, and graphs are used to visualize the data.

Breast cancer data set:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

Attribute Information:
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.
All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
Missing attribute values: none
Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant

Prison data set:

Prisoner Information Dataset
Prison Statistics India (PSI) - 2020
This dataset contains information about the prisoners in India in 2020.
A criminal is a person who is guilty of a crime, notably breaking the law. A prisoner is a person incarcerated in a prison, while on trial or serving a sentence

It has 87 columns and 39 rows. The columns include the state or union territory, the educational standard, the domicile, the religion, the gender, the age group, the type of prison, and the type of offense.
The rows include the total for each state or union territory and the total for all of India.
The dataset is based on the Prison Statistics India (PSI) report published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).
The dataset can be used for analysis and visualization of the prisoner's statistics
